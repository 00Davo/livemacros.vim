INTRO                                                      *livemacros-intro*

Write and refine a Vim macro in a regular buffer, with a live preview of the
macro's results when on your original buffer. When you're done writing a
macro, just close the livemacro window, and the macro will be saved in a
register ready to use.

Simple usage: >
  "m:Livemacro<CR>
  ^3wdwj<ESC>:q
  @m@m@m
<

OPTIONS                                                  *livemacros-options*

livemacros.vim has only one option.

                                                      *'g:loaded_livemacros'*
Use this to disable the plugin completely: >
  let g:loaded_livemacros = 1
<

COMMANDS                                                *livemacros-commands*

                                                                  *:Livemacro*
["x]:Livemacro [register]
  Start a livemacro to be run upon the current buffer, stored in the register
  specified with either "x |quote| or [register] ("x takes precedence). The
  current contents of the specified register will be used as the initial
  contents of the livemacro, if the register isn't empty.

  If no register is given, the livemacro will be stored in the unnamed
  register |quotequote|. This can be fragile, since the unnamed register is so
  prone to change; it is recommended that livemacros are always stored in the
  named registers |quotea|.

                                                            *:LivemacroUpdate*
:LivemacroUpdate
  While writing a livemacro, refresh the preview of its results on the source
  buffer. This command shouldn't usually be needed, since livemacros refresh
  their own previews automatically, but it's there and might be useful if
  livemacros.vim seems to get "stuck".

  Note that this command forces the macro to be reapplied to the source
  buffer; normally, livemacros will not reapply unless the buffer has actually
  been changed.

                                                            *:LivemacroCancel*
:LivemacroCancel
  While writing a livemacro, return to the original buffer, deleting the
  livemacro in progress. The previous state of the original buffer and the
  register that stored the livemacro will both be restored.

MAPPINGS                                                *livemacros-mappings*

livemacros.vim defines no mappings of its own. It is recommended that you
define a mapping for the |:Livemacro| command, however: >
  nnoremap Q :Livemacro<CR>
<

The above mapping requires you to use |quote| to specify a register. This can
be very inconvenient and works differently to the analogous command |q|,
however, so livemacros.vim provides an alternative mapping option.

You can automatically generate mappings which allow you to specify the
register name after the binding itself, just like with |q|; for example, Qx
might start recording a livemacro into register x. To do this: >
  call livemacros#setup#map('Q')
<
